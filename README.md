Hi, I'm Tharun — a Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies. I enjoy building scalable, user-centric applications and writing clean, maintainable code that’s easy to collaborate on and optimize.

## Tech Stack

React.js • JavaScript • Angular 8+ • TypeScript • Node.js  
.NET Core • SQL Server • Entity Framework • REST APIs  
Tailwind CSS • Bootstrap • Azure DevOps • CI/CD Pipelines

## About Me

I’m comfortable working across the stack, from creating responsive UIs to designing APIs and handling data models.

In addition to my technical work, I care deeply about performance, accessibility, and clean architecture. I regularly take on coding challenges and enjoy staying current with modern best practices in web development.

Outside of tech, I enjoy traveling, playing cricket, and watching movies. I’m always up for a good conversation about architecture, design systems, or efficient database queries.
